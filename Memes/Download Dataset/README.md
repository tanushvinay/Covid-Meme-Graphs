# Downloading the dataset 

The dataset for the mems have been taken from the library of congress archive: https://www.loc.gov/item/2018655320/

The dataset is stored as a csv format containing links to the image and the test that goes on the image. We need to manually download the images and put the text on it ourselves. The code for doing so is in this folder.

The dataset can be downloaded by running download.py and it will store the memes in the current working directory
